	What is File?

	File is collection records or data store permanantly on HD.
	.txt file,.java file, .docs file, .json file,.xml file.

	Java have the ability to create any type of file and can perform 
 	various operations on that file
	such as reading, writing or appending operation.
	Mechanism used to perform all these operations on file is nothing 
but file handling. To perform file handling java provided package java.io
which provides variaous classes and interfaces.
FileInputStream FileOutStream, FileReader,FileWriter etc

	INPUT AND OUTPUT OPERATION

Stream: It is sequence of data.It is like stream of water.So it is stream of data.
It is used when we are tranfereing data from source to destination.
This stream contains sequence of bytes.


	Source---->1010110011100----->File

Stream can input stream or output stream.

InputStream-> In reading the data
OutputStream-> writing the data

1.Byte Stream: Data will be represented as sequence of bytes ie 0 and 1
	FileInputStream
	FileOutputStream etc.
	
	ObjectInputStream
	ObjectOutputStream

2.Character Stream:Data will be represented as sequence of character
	FileReader
	FileWriter


	File is class:

	File f = new File("filename with path");
	File f = new File("information.txt");
	
Methods:
1. boolean isFile(): It is used to check weather specified name is
file or not. If yes it returns true else it returns false.

2. boolean isDirectory(): It is used to check weather specified name is 
directory/folder or not. If it is folder it returns true else false.

3. boolean exists(): It is used to check weather specifed file is exist or not.
if it is exists it returns true else it returns false.

	if(f.exists() && f.isFile()){
		//Operation
	}else{

		//not exists or not file
	}


4. String[] list(): It returns names of all files and sub folders present in
specified folder.

		String name[] = f.list();

==========================================================

Read Operation:
Getting data from file is nothing but read operation.
Following are the Steps:

1. File f = new File("File Name with path");

2. FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(f);
It opens file in read mode if exists. 
If file open file cursor points to the begining of file.

Methods:
1. int read(): It reads character UNICODE value where cursor is currently 
present. And cursor automatically moves to next character.
If file end occur it return -1


	while(true){
		int i = fin.read();
		if(i == -1){
			break;
		}
		sop((char)i);
	
	}

Welcome

2. Write Operation: Adding data into file is nothing but write operation.
Follwing are the steps:

1. Use File class
	File f = new File("file name with path");

2. FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(f);
It is used to open file in write mode.
As file is exists it will overide the content.
If file is not exists it creates new file.

If we dont wants to override the content or delete previous contet then we can
open file in append mode.

FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(f,true);//Append

Methods:
1.void close(): It is available to InputStream as well as output stream
It is used to close streams
		fin.close();
		fout.close();

2. void write(int): It is used to add character into file where file cursor
is present,as character is get added cursor automatically goes to next position.

	fout.write(i);

	Copy the content from file to another
