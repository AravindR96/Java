Exception is runtime error or anamoly which stops the execution of program
or application abnormally.
So interrupts the normal execution flow of your code.

Error:
1. Compile Time error: ; missing
2. Runtime Error: Will not identify to compiler.
Mechanism used to resolve such runtime errors ie exceptions is nothing but
exception handling.

Here Exception is class present in java.lang package

class Division{
	public void division(int num1 , int num2){
		sop("In division method");
		int div = num1 / num2;//divide by zero 
		sop("Division = " + div);
	}
	public void enjoy(){
		sop("I m Enjoying!!!!");
	}

}
Division obj = new Division();
obj.division(10,5);//Calling
obj.division(10,0);
obj.enjoy();


Situations When eexception get raised:
1. When we try to divide number by zero
2. When we try to process String having null vaulue
3. When we try access element out of bound from  array or String etc

try-catch

try{

	//try block
}catch(AnyExceptionClass e){
	//catch block	
}
try block contains code which might raised exception
catch block contains error handlig code.
Catch block is get executed only when exception get raised.
If no matching catch clause it will treat like we have not handled exception.
Executuion will stoped
Exception Hierarchy:


			  Throwable

	Exception 			Error
		IOException
		SQLException				StackOverFlowError
		ClassNotFoundExcption			VirtualMachineError
		RuntimeException
	    		ArithmeticException		OutOfMemoryErorr etc			
	    		NullPointerException
	    		ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException			
	    		StringIndexOutOfBoundsException			
					




General Catch Clause:

try{

}catch(Exception e){

}


Multiple Catch clauses:

try{

}catch(ExceptionType1 e1){

}catch(ExceptionType2 e2){

}catch(ExceptionType3 e3){

}catch(Exception e){

}

General Catch claue should putted at last
otherwise unreachable code error will be get occur.

finally clause: Finally caluse is get executed compulsary weather exception get raised or not
If we have code that must be get executed compulsary weather exception
raised or not.
Such code must be putted in fainally clause

try{

}catch(ExceptionType1 e1){

}catch(ExceptionType2 e2){

}catch(ExceptionType3 e3){

}finally{
	//Compulsary code

}

Database connection closing code
File Closing operation
Socket Closing

Is it possible to write try without catch???
Answer is YES.
try{

}finally{

}

In this if exception get raised it will be treated as not handled
and hence execution will be get stopped/interrupted
Here finally clause get executed
====================================================

Types Of Exceptions:

1. Checked Exceptions: Also called called as compile time exception
Checked exceptions are checked for exception handling code at compile time.
If we have not handled exception compiler gives error.

	IOException
	SQlException
	ClassNotFoundException
	InteruptedException

2. UnChecked Exception: Also called as run time exceptions

Unchecked exceptions are not checked for exception handling code at compile time
These are check at run time only ie dynamically
 	
	NullPoiterException
	ArithmeticException
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
