	interface:
It is user defined data type which specifies behaviour that must implement
by classes.
Methods in interface are by default public and abstract.
Since Java 8 interface contain abstract as well as non abstract methods.
That means interface can have methods with body.
That non abstract abstract methods can be default method or static method
We can not create object of interface but we can create variable of interface type.
interface achieve 100% abstraction
abstract class can achieve 0-100% abstraction

	public interface InterfaceName{
		//abstract method
		//non-abstract method(default and static methods)
		//final static variables

	}

	public interface Operation{
		void addition(int num1 , int num2);
	}

interface have to implement by class using implements keyword.
If interface is implemented by class then class have to define(provide body) all abstract
methods present in it otherwise class have to declare as abstract class.
Reference variable of type interface can refer object of class which 
implements it.
	class Demo implements Operation{
		public void addition(int num1 , int num2){
			---
			---
		}
	}

	//Operation ref = new Operation();//ERROR
	Operation ref;
	ref = new Demo();
	ref.addition(10,20);

By using interface variable we can invoke only methods from interface.
Original methods of that class can not be called by using interface variable.

Note1: Can one interface is implemented by more than one class?
Answer is YES.


class Demo1 implements Operation{
	public void addition(int num1, int num2){

	}
}

		  Operation (Interface)
	
	Demo(Class)			Demo1(Class)


Uses:
-interface is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
-interface is used to achieve abstraction.

Demo-------------->obj
			|	Operation ref.addition(10,20);
Demo1------------->obj1
Note2: Can One class implement more than one interfaces???
Answer is YES.(Multiple Inheritance)

	Operation(Interface) 	Operation1(Interface)
			
		 	Demo


	class Demo implements Operation, Operation1{
		//Define abstract methods from both interfaces.
	
	}

Note3: Can interface be extended???
Answer is YES.

One interface can extends another interface.
ie Parent Child relationship between interfaces is possible in java.

interface Parent{
	void display();
}

interface Child extends Parent{
	void show();
}


class Demo implements Child{
//It have to define all abstract methods from Parent as well as Child interface
//define display() and show()
}

Note4: Can one interface extends more than one interfaces.
can Multiple inheritance is possible in interface inheritance??
Answer is YES.
All are interfaces

	Parent1		Parent2


		Child

interface Parent1{

}
interface Parent2{

}
interface Child extends Parent1,Parent2{


}
