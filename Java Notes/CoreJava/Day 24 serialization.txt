Character Stream Classes
	FileReader
	FileWriter

Serialization and Deserialization

FileReader: If we have to retrive data from file.

	FileReader reader = new FileReader(f);

	while(true){
		int i = reader.read();
		if(i== -1){
			break;
		}
		sop((char)i);
	}

FileWriter: It is character stream class which is used to perform write or output 
operation.

FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(f);

	writer.write(i);

reader.close();
writer.close();

Serialization and DeSerialization

Serialization: It is process of maintaining state of user defined object 
into file so that it can easily retrive that object data.

Serialization is similler marshling mechanism used in RMI.
Conversion of java object into Data Transferable format is nothing but serialization
To perform Serialization in java we use class
ObjectOutputStream oos = null;
	oos.writeObject(emp);
where emp is object of Employee class

Machine1------------->Machine2
Serilization		DeSerialization
class Employee implements Serializable{
	empId;
	empName;
	empSalary;
}



DeSerialization: It is reverse process of serialization. ie Conversion of 
Data transferable format into java Object.
It is similler to UnMarshling mechanism used in RMI.
In deserialization maintained state of object is used to retrive the record.
To perform deserialization in java we use
ObjectInputStream ois = null;
 Employee emp = (Employee)ois.readObject();

oos.close();
ois.close();

Note: whenever we have to implement seriaization and Deserialization the class
which object have serialize must implement Serializable interface
