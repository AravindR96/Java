 JUnit:

	Testing is important part of software development life cycle.
	Here we have to tet the source code written by developer. 
The testing perform to test source code is called as unit testing.
In unit testing smallest block of code ie method or function is going to test.
This testing can be done by developer only.

To perform unit testing we use Junit as testing framework.

In this we have to write test cases. The test cases are the special methods
from test class in which we write testing logic.In Junit framework these methods
will be annoted using @Test annotation.
In unit testing we provide some dummy input will get output, this out put will be 
compared or checked with expected output.According to this comparisn
test case will be passes or failed. If test case is failed that means defects or
some buggs are there in code,we as developer have to resolved it.

public class TestAddition{
	@Test
	public void testAddition(){//TestCase
		//testing
	}
	@Test
	public void testConcatnation(){//TestCase
		//testing
	}
}

public class Addition{
	public int addition(int num1 , int num2){
		int sum;
		sum = num1 * num2;
		return sum;
	}
	public String concatnation(String s1 , String s2){

		return s1 + s2;
	}	

}
