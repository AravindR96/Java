	JSP:

JSP Stands for Java/Jakarta Server Pages.
It is used to create dynamic web pages like servlet.
It is extension to servlet as it have cocepts like customtags,jstl etc.
By using jsp presentation logic and business logic will be get separated.
Jsp page is combination of HTML,Java
It is like html just saved with .jsp extension.
Writing JSP is easy than servlet as less code required.
No need to recompile.

JSP page will be translated to Servlet by JSP translator and then followed 
servlet life cycle.
JSP translator is component of web container which is used to maintain jsp
life cycle.

	jsp life cycle:
JSP Follows specific life cycle. Life cycle of jsp will be followed
container.

Through Methods:

	jspInit()----->Initilization 

	_jspService()------> Business Logic 


	jspDestroy()------> Deallocation/shutdown


Through Phases:
home.jsp

1. JSP Translation Phase:
In this JSP is translated to Servlet. That smply means JSP file is converted by container
into Servlet. When first time JSP page is invoked or there is change in JSP
page it will be translated to sevlet.Here .jsp is converted to .java
home.java

2.JSP Compilation Phase:
Generated .java file is compiled and .class file is get created.
home.class

3. JSP Class Loading Phase:
The .class file is get loaded into container.

4. JSP Instantiation Phase:
Object of Generated Servlet is created in this phase.Here object is created by container.

5. JSP Initilization:
	In this phase execution of jspInit(). Initilization needed to jsp is get done
in this phase.

6. JSP Service Phase: 
In this phase actual request processing is done. In this _jspService() method execution is get happened.
This method can be called for many times for every request. So the business logic
is get exected in this phase.

7. JSP Destruction Phase:
It is last phase of jsp life cycle. It is used to release the resources used
by jsp.
	jspDestroy()  method execution is happened.
	JSP = <HTML,JAVA,JSP Elements>

		Elements Of JSP:

A.JSP Scripting Elements: There are three scripting elements.

1. <scriptlet>: It is used to write java code.

	<jsp:scriptlet>
		//Java Code

	</jsp:scriptlet>

		OR
	<%


		//Java Code


	%>

2. Declaration: It is used to declare variables or methods

	<%!

		//Variable or method Declaration


	%>


3. Expression: 

	It evaluate expression and display output on browser.

	<%= expression>

	<%= 10+20>

We can write any number of expression tags on jsp.
But one tag should contain only one expression.


	JSP Directives:

These are instructions given to the container for translating JSP into Servlet.
There are three directives.
These instructions will be given at translation time.
1. page directive
2. include directive
3. taglib directive

Sysntax:

	<%@ directiveName attribute1=value1 attribute2=value2 ...>

	ex. <%@ page import="java.util.*">

	    <%@ inclue >

		<%@ taglib >

1. Page Directive:
The attributes specified to page directive will be applicable to entire jsp
page.

import---> It is used to import java packages.
contentType--->It is used to specify MIME Type
extends--->It is to specify parent class for container generated java class
session--->It is used to enable or desable session tracking on JSP. If we specify
session value as true it will create session

<%@ page session = "true">

errorPage---> It is used to specify error page ie the page which should be
get executed when some error or exeception get occur on jsp page.

<%@ page errorPage="error.jsp">
----
----
----

isErrorPage: It is used in error page to specify that this page will 
acts as error page.

<%@ page isErrorPage="true">
----
----Something goes Wrong
---

Session Tracking in JSP:

In JSP session is implicit object. We dont need to create this object just we can use it to set or to get 
attribute.

With that we just have to use session = true in page directive
